1.Software Principles:There are different types of software principles which helps to make a successful software enterprise
 1.Abstraction
 2.modularity
 3.anticipation to change
 4.generality
 5.niche targetibility
 6.robustness

2.Software functions Layers: types of layers are primitives,perpectual abillity,palnning,time scale, use of models.

3.Primitives layers are Sense>Think>Act>Learn cycle.

4.Reactive Layer : Its Sense > Act cycle with no Plan. This kind of layers help in error handeling and react on exceptions

5.Interactive Layer : this layer can be summerized as the swarm technique, where both agents need to talk to each other in order to acheive some task.
6.Shared control : this function allows the involvement of both human and computer to sucessfully acheive the task.

7.Traded control : This function is depended on 1st person to finish the job (either can be computer or human).once its complete 2nd part is approached.
8.Types of autonomy : No autonomy,process autonomy,intentional autonomy,constrain autonomy,system-state autonomy

9.Two system architecture paradigms : 1. Interaction between primitives (Sense>plan>act,sense > act, plane>Sense>Act).
 2. Sensing route (global,Local and hybrid)

10.Execution approval and task execution : the cycle of sense>plan>Approve>Act can be in execution approval which involves the approval
 Process (SIMULATION run before deploying it to robots)

11. What is Autonomy: Autonomy in robotics is based on a canonical operational architecture with three layers: reaction, deliberation, and interaction.
The hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture is a suitable systems architecture that combines these layers. The operational architecture separates reactive behaviors from cognitive functions and adds an interaction layer for communication.
12. Features of Autonomy: It employs a Sense Plan Act flow with distributed sensing and functions operating at different time scales. Replacing humans into the loop to check robot plans often does not work as expected.
13. Programming Style: The programming style for autonomy involves thinking in biological metaphors to capture the robot's capabilities. General purpose intelligence is organized in layers, but not all layers are needed for every task.
14. Advantages: Successful autonomous capabilities, like navigation, typically require all layers to be considered in the design. Neglecting to consider all deliberative functions can lead to mission failures and increased manpower demands.
15. Structure of Architecture: The layers in the architecture do not represent an incremental development roadmap. Robots are generally designed for complete functionality, not easy additions.
16. Role of AI: The amount of artificial intelligence a robot needs depends on its desired capabilities.
17. Operations: Simple tasks may be accomplished with basic behaviors, while complex missions require sophisticated planning. These questions include what functions the robot needs to provide and the planning horizon for those functions.
18. The speed at which algorithms update depends on real-time control or planning requirements. The type of model required by the robot can be task-specific or task-independent.
19. Human Role: The role of humans in fine-grained monitoring of robots is introduced.
20. Summary: The layout of the canonical operational architecture and hybrid systems architecture serves as a basis for algorithms in the book.
21.Abstraction: It means focusing on the main ideas and not getting lost in small details.
22.Modularity: Think of software like building with blocks - each piece should be like a separate block that can be easily put together.
23.Anticipation of Change: Good software is ready for updates and improvements without breaking the existing parts.
24.Generality: Software should be flexible enough to be used for different purposes, like how a tool can be used for various jobs in robotics.
25.No Autonomy: The robot strictly follows preset instructions, like always doing the same thing in response to certain situations.
26.Process Autonomy: The robot can choose different methods or strategies to achieve its goals, similar to selecting different approaches.
27.Systems-State Autonomy: The robot can generate and select from various options to reach its goals. This makes its actions less predictable.
28.Intentional Autonomy: The robot can change its goals to be a better team player, even if it means doing something different from its usual role, and it can negotiate with others.
29.programming framework : The programming framework unites an operational architecture that explains a robot's actions with a systems architecture that outlines the essential systems for its operation.
30.programming style The programming style for autonomy is to use biological metaphors to model the robot's required reaction, deliberation, and interaction as a complete system.

31.Biological intelligence: is the smarts and problem-solving abilities found in living things, like humans and animals. It involves how living creatures perceive, learn, solve problems, and adapt to their surroundings using their brains and bodies.

32.The Sensing Route :in robotics refers to the way sensor data is used to facilitate autonomous capabilities. There are three main routes for sensor data: local sensing, reactive, and deliberative. These routes represent choices in computational complexity, cost, latency, and whether to imitate animal sensing structures.

33.The Planning subsystem: is responsible for creating and overseeing the main goals of a mission, then transmitting the spatial information of those goals to the navigation subsystem.

34.The Perception subsystem: referred to as the Sensing or Perceptual Schema Library, is responsible for choosing the most suitable sensors for motor actions and executing sensor processing algorithms. 

35.Constraint autonomy :in robotics means that the robot can set its own roles and goals, even if it means changing its initial constraints or methods

36.Process autonomy: Process autonomy in robotics refers to the robot's ability to independently select the most suitable algorithm or method to accomplish its task goals.

37. architectural paradigms :In the history of AI robotics, three main paradigms have been identified: hierarchical, reactive, and hybrid deliberative/reactive.

38.Technical architecture: outlines the practical implementation of a system, akin to how a house is built.

39. Operational architecture: defines the high-level functionality of a system without delving into the specifics of how it accomplishes these tasks.

40.Mataric software architecture: It focuses on creating robust and adaptive behaviors for robots, especially in social and healthcare settings.
